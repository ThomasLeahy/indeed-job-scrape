# Scraping indeed.com

A small data science project to scrape data science job adverts from the [indeed.com](https://www.indeed.co.uk) website.

The project will consist of two parts: 
  1. Scraping relevant data from the website.
  2. Analysing and visualising this data to extract meaningful information.

Aim: To provide information regarding the skills required for particular positions. We will demonstrate this with a example for the skills required for a "Data Scientist" as per the job descriptions on indeed.com.
